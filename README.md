# My Web Application

This is a basic web application that allows users to input data via a form.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML code for the user input form.
- `app.js`: Contains client-side JavaScript code for form validation and submission.
- `server.js`: Contains server-side code to handle form submissions and interact with the database.

## Database (Pending)

Database functionality is pending. Follow the steps outlined below to set up the database.

## Setting Up the Database

1. Install MySQL Server.
2. Create a new database named `user_data`.
3. Create a table named `users` with fields: ID, Name, Email, Age, Date of Birth.

## Running the Application

1. Start the server by running `node server.js`.
2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Next Steps

- Integrate database functionality into `server.js`.
- Test database connectivity and functionality.
- Update README with progress and additional information.
